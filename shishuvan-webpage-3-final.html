<h2>Little chefs club</h2>
<p>Cooking can give children and teens a great sense of satisfaction and build their self-confidence. When children cook, they are learning many skills, including math and reading skills as well as how to work together. They also get a chance to practice motor skills and concentration through things like pouring, stirring, and measuring. Cooking is a great sensory experience that children enjoy. When they prepare by having the basic supplies on hand and selecting some simple recipes, we are setting the stage for learning and fun through cooking. Cooking activities are messy too! Children can pick up on our tension if we are worried about messes. Then they could become nervous and afraid of making more messes and mistakes. If we are relaxed about messes and mistakes, the children will be too. If we teach a positive attitude towards trying to things and making mistakes, we are doing much more than just teaching cooking. So we keep dustbin, plenty of rags handy and a smile on our faces!</p>

<h4><i>Advantages of Clay workshop:</i><p/>
<ol>
  <li>Beneficial for developing motor skills: Children pound, pinch, flatten, tear, poke, squeeze, coil, roll and bend their clay into all sorts of shapes and sizes. This is an excellent way to improve dexterity and strengthen large and fine motor skills</li>
  <li>Clay is Therapeutic: Clay is a wonderful tactile medium that can be very calming for both children and adults. Manipulating the clay can be an outlet for children to convey their emotions and reduce stress.</li>
  <li>Self-esteem: Clay is quick to mold and children feel they are in charge of the medium. This feeling gives them the confidence to communicate their vision. Once children learn to express their personal visions in clay, they can be empowered in ways that go far beyond the art room.</li>
  <li> Creative problem solving: Playing with clay stimulates children's imaginations. Children playing with clay can experiment with building techniques and adapt to change along the way. This type of learning promotes problem-solving skills.</li>
